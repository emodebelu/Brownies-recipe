# Brownies-recipe

Hi everyone

This project is created to show the Best Recipes to create the Best-Brownies of your life...!

In This Project I will work on my HTML, CSS, and a little bit of my writing skills.., My Essays.


I will also practice in HTML
<ul> 

<li>Elements and Tags</li>
<li>My HTML BoilerPlate</li>
<li>working with Text</li>
<li>creating list</li>
<li>links & images</li>
<li>etc</li>

</ul>

So Basically I created the HTML5! file (index.html) with links filled up in it.., essays and photos, I also used the P and H1 element and tags.., linked them up to other pages in the recipe folder, created 7 lists of recipes, now i'm about to fill it up with more information.
